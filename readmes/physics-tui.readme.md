##  Project Status

This project is **complete and ready for use** as a comprehensive physics reference tool. It covers 12 major physics topics with over 6,800 lines of well-documented code, including extensive calculations and interactive features.

**Current Status:** Stable release - The project is feature-complete for its intended scope. While I may add enhancements like unit conversion calculators in the future, the current version provides a fully functional physics reference and calculation platform.

**Development Note:** Active development is paused as I focus on preparing for University of Cambridge (MPhil in Scientific Computing), but the project remains stable and fully usable. I may occasionally tinker with improvements during free time.

**User Note**: This app was developed with dark mode themes in mind and not optimized for light themes. My apologies to anyone who needs to utilize light mode for accessibility purposes.

## Educational Context

This project was developed as both a learning exercise in Python software development and a practical tool for physics education. It demonstrates:

- Advanced Python programming concepts
- TUI application development with Textual
- Professional software development practices
- Comprehensive testing and documentation

The project serves as both a useful physics reference tool and an example of well-structured scientific software.

## Platform Support

**Tested and working on:**
