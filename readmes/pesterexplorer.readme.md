## Overview

Pester does a wonderful job printing out tests results as they're running. The
difficulty can be where you're looking at a large number of results.

## Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This module is for PowerShell 7. This won't work in Windows PowerShell.

```pwsh
Install-Module PesterExplorer -Scope CurrentUser
```

Installing this module will install it's dependencies which are Pester and
PwshSpectreConsole.

## Examples

To explore your result object you simply need to run `Show-PesterResult`

```pwsh
# Run Pester and make sure to PassThru the object
$pester = Invoke-Pester .\tests\ -PassThru
# Now run the TUI
Show-PesterResult $p
```

You can also get a tree view of your pester results with
`Show-PesterResultTree`.

```pwsh
# Run Pester and make sure to PassThru the object
$pester = Invoke-Pester .\tests\ -PassThru
# Now get that in a Tree view
Show-PesterResultTree $p
```
